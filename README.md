# Vet Registration Form (Work in Progress)

## Project Description

The Vet Registration Form is a web-based application designed to collect registration information from veterinary clinic clients. This project aims to streamline the registration process, making it convenient for both clients and clinic staff.

**Note:** This project is a **work in progress** and is continually being developed. It is also important to note that, since the project is currently in its early stages, significant transformations are anticipated. The final result may bear little resemblance to its current state, as it undergoes continuous development and refinement.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The primary HTML file that defines the webpage structure.
- **style.css:** The CSS file responsible for styling the webpage and form elements.
- **index.js:** The JavaScript file handling form interactions and dynamic inputs.

## How to Use

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (or click [here](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/Vet-Registration-Form/)).

You will be able to:
- Fill out the registration form with client and pet information.
- Add information for multiple pets using the "Add a Pet" button.
- Observe the form displaying the name of the pet in order to organize and separate each pet's information.
- Customize the form based on the type of pet (e.g., dog, cat, etc.).
- Indicate whether each pet has a chip number.
- Provide medical history and observations for each pet.
- Create an account login with a password.
