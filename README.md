# Vet Registration Form (Work in Progress)

## Project Description

The Vet Registration Form is a web-based application designed to collect registration information from veterinary clinic clients. This project aims to streamline the registration process, making it convenient for both clients and clinic staff.

**Note:** This project is a **work in progress** and is continually being developed. It is also important to note that, since the project is currently in its early stages, significant transformations are anticipated. The final result may bear little resemblance to its current state, as it undergoes continuous development and refinement.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The primary HTML file that defines the webpage structure.
- **style.css:** The CSS file responsible for styling the webpage and form elements.
- **index.js:** The JavaScript file handling form interactions and dynamic inputs.
- **underConstruction.html:** File responsible for defining the 'Under Construction' page.
- **underConstruction.css:** The CSS file responsible  for defining the 'Under Construction' page.

You will also find the following files:
- **LICENSE:** Responsible for informing you the license this web app is under.
- **README.md:** This file, itself, responsible for guiding you throughout this form.
- **Attributions:** Folder containing all the attributions and copyright notices for this project.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Form**: 
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
   - Alternatively, you can access the form online by clicking [here](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/Vet-Registration-Form/).

2. **Fill Out the Form**: 
   - Fill out the registration form with client and pet information.

3. **Add Multiple Pets**: 
   - Add information for multiple pets using the "Add a Pet" button.
   - The form will display the name of each pet to help you organize and separate their information.

4. **Customize for Each Pet**: 
   - Customize the form for each pet based on their type (e.g., dog, cat, etc.).

5. **Chip Number**: 
   - Indicate whether each pet has a chip number.

6. **Medical History and Observations**: 
   - Provide medical history and any relevant observations for each pet.

7. **Create an Account**: 
   - Create an account login with a password.

8. **Submission Validations**: 
   - When you click the "Submit Registration" button, the form will perform submission validations.
   - It will inform you if anything is incorrectly filled out, such as required fields left empty, unselected options, password mismatches, or not meeting password requirements.

9. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Review the password requirements before creating your account.

10. **Navigation**:
    - Clicking on the "Navigation Menu" button (the three horizontal lines) in the header allows you to access different sections of the website, including "Our Team," "Pet Care," "Contact," "Appointments," "Registration," and "My Pets."
    - Right at the top of the page you can also interact with links to sections such as "Contact", "Pet Care", "Our Team" and "My Pets".
    - Down in tghe footer there are more navigation links that redirect you to various sections such as "Make an Appointment", "News", "Work for Us", etc...
      
All of the above will redirect you to an "Under Construction" page, even though they will never be built as this project is referent to a form page only. The "Under Construction" page serves as an interesting way to fill the navigation links.

But at the footer you will also find:
- An *Instragram* icon that will redirect you to the official Instragam webpage when clicked on.
- A *Facebook* icon that will redirect you to the official Instragam webpage when clicked on.
- An *X (twitter)* icon that will redirtect you to the official X (twitter) webpage when clicked on.
